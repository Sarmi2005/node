        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Jebin Mon M P, a dedicated and ambitious final-year Engineering student specializing in Electronics and Communication. My educational journey began with a strong foundation in academics, having achieved outstanding results in both my 10th and 12th grades as a CBSE student. This academic success laid the groundwork for my subsequent pursuit of a degree in engineering. My passion for technology and innovation led me to explore full-stack development, where I aim to integrate my knowledge of electronics with cutting-edge software practices. My short-term goal is to become a skilled Full Stack Developer, proficient in both front-end and back-end technologies. My academic background, combined with practical experience through various projects and internships, has equipped me with a robust skill set and a deep understanding of technologyâ€™s potential to address complex challenges.</p>
       <p> In addition to my academic achievements, I am actively involved in the engineering community as a member of IEEE, which has broadened my professional network and provided me with leadership opportunities. My hands-on experience includes significant projects such as the Soil Moisturizer Tracking system, developed during my internship at Techvolt Coimbatore in 2023, and the Smart Wireless EV Charging system, designed during my tenure at Pantech Pvt Ltd Chennai in 2024. These projects have deepened my expertise in IoT and embedded systems, reinforcing my commitment to technological innovation. Looking ahead, I am driven by a long-term goal of becoming an entrepreneur, leveraging my technical skills to create impactful solutions and contribute to technological progress. With a strong academic foundation and a passion for continuous learning, I am excited about the future and the opportunities it holds for making a meaningful difference in the tech industry.</p>
