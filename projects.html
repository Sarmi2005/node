            <h3>Soil Moisturizer Tracking</h3>
            <p>During my internship at Techvolt Coimbatore in 2023, I had the opportunity to work on the Soil Moisturizer Tracking project, which aimed to address the challenges of efficient irrigation in agriculture. This project involved designing a system that utilized Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs) to monitor soil moisture levels in real-time. The core objective was to develop a reliable and cost-effective solution that could provide accurate soil moisture readings and help farmers optimize their irrigation schedules. My role included configuring the sensor hardware, developing the firmware for data acquisition, and implementing a data logging system to track moisture levels over time.</p>
            <p>In addition to the technical development, I also worked on integrating the data collection system with a user-friendly interface, allowing users to view moisture levels and receive alerts when the soil reached critical dryness levels. This involved creating a simple web-based dashboard that displayed real-time data and historical trends. The project not only enhanced my skills in sensor interfacing and data analysis but also provided valuable insights into the practical applications of technology in agriculture. The system was well-received by the team and demonstrated significant potential for improving irrigation efficiency and conserving water resources.</p>

            <h3>Smart Wireless EV Charging</h3>
            <p>At Pantech Pvt Ltd Chennai in 2024, I contributed to the development of a Smart Wireless EV Charging system, designed to provide a convenient and efficient solution for electric vehicle (EV) charging. The project aimed to create a wireless charging system that could seamlessly charge EVs without the need for physical connectors. This innovative solution leveraged inductive charging technology, which allows for power transfer between the charging pad and the vehicle through electromagnetic fields. My responsibilities included designing the charging pad, developing the control algorithms for power regulation, and integrating the system with an intuitive user interface.</p>
            <p>The Smart Wireless EV Charging system featured advanced functionalities such as automatic alignment detection, which ensured that the vehicle was properly positioned over the charging pad for optimal power transfer. Additionally, the system included safety features to prevent overcharging and overheating. I worked closely with a multidisciplinary team to test and refine the system, addressing challenges related to power efficiency and electromagnetic interference. This project provided me with hands-on experience in wireless power transfer, IoT integration, and smart technology development. The successful implementation of this system highlighted the potential of wireless charging to enhance the user experience and drive the adoption of electric vehicles.</p>
